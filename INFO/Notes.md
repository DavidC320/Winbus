## Getting unit groups working

Winbus is now playable, The player can place units on the field and watch them fight the other players units. But I need to figure out a way to place multiple units using one card.

So here is what I was thinking of using a matrix system to do this.

    units= [
        [dagger, dagger, dagger],
        [dagger, dagger, dagger],
        [dagger, dagger, dagger]
    ]

    units= [
        [dagger, dagger],
        [dagger, dagger]
    ]
